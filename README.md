# PCD21 — Generative Type Design Workshop

Imagine an empty Christmas tree 🌲 and a Christmas tree with decorations 🎄.
Now the Christmas tree is a typographic skeleton, and the decoration is any shape that you use to give it form.
That’s what we will be doing in this workshop, exploring possibilities to create unique glyphs/letters based on typographic skeletons and drawing techniques.
We will be using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which enables all our creativity to be limited only to the imagination.

## Requirements, but not really

- If you are new to P5.js, please check this [brief introduction](https://github.com/baselcodes/PCD2021/tree/main/P5JS%20for%20Beginners).
- A code editor. I don't recommend any. PS: use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- If you are in the cool team, install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code so you don't have to reload every time you update the code. Also, I like the [GitHub theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme).
